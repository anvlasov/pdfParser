Installation Always wear protective gloves, clothing, and eyewear when performing any installation operations to avoid personal injury.
Personal injury or equipment damage caused by sudden release of pressure may result if the valve assembly is installed where service conditions could exceed the limits given in table 1 or on the appropriate nameplates. To avoid such injury or damage, provide a relief valve for over‐pressure protection as required by government or accepted industry codes and good engineering practices. 
Check with your process or safety engineer for any additional measures that must be taken to protect against process media. 
If installing into an existing application, also refer to the WARNING at the beginning of the Maintenance section in this instruction manual. 
1.  Before installing the valve, inspect the valve and associated equipment for any damage and any foreign material. 
2.  Make certain the valve body interior is clean, that pipelines are free of foreign material, and that the valve is oriented so that pipeline flow is in the same direction as the arrow on the side of the valve. 
3.  The control valve assembly may be installed in any orientation unless limited by seismic criteria. However, the normal method is with the actuator vertical above the valve. Other positions may result in uneven valve plug and cage wear, and improper operation. With some valves, the actuator may also need to be supported when it is not vertical. For more information, consult your Emerson sales office. 
4.  Use accepted piping and welding practices when installing the valve in the line. For flanged valves, use a suitable gasket between the valve and pipeline flanges. 
5.  With a leak‐off bonnet construction, remove the pipe plugs (keys 14 and 16, figure 14) to hook up the leak‐off piping. If continuous operation is required during inspection or maintenance, install a three‐valve bypass around the control valve assembly. 
6.  If the actuator and valve are shipped separately, refer to the actuator mounting procedure in the appropriate actuator instruction manual. 
Instruction Manual D100398X012 ET Valve August 2021 
CAUTION When ordered, the valve configuration and construction materials were selected to meet particular pressure, temperature, pressure drop, and controlled fluid conditions. Responsibility for the safety of process media and compatibility of valve materials with process media rests solely with the purchaser and end‐user. Since some valve body/trim material combinations are limited in their pressure drop and temperature ranges, do not apply any other conditions to the valve without first contacting your Emerson sales office. Before installing the valve, inspect the valve and pipelines for any damage and any foreign material which may cause product damage.
CAUTION Depending on valve body materials used, post weld heat treating may be required. If so, damage to internal elastomeric and plastic parts, as well as internal metal parts is possible. Shrink‐fit pieces and threaded connections may also loosen. In general, if post weld heat treating is to be performed, all trim parts should be removed. Contact your Emerson sales office for additional information.

  WARNING 
Personal injury could result from packing leakage. Valve packing was tightened prior to shipment; however, the packing might require some readjustment to meet specific service conditions. Check with your process or safety engineer for any additional measures that must be taken to protect against process media. 
Valves with ENVIRO‐SEAL live‐loaded packing or HIGH‐SEAL live‐loaded packing will not require this initial readjustment. See the Fisher instruction manuals, ENVIRO‐SEAL Packing System for Sliding‐Stem Valves or HIGH‐SEAL Live‐Loaded Packing System (as appropriate), for packing instructions. If you wish to convert your present packing arrangement to ENVIRO‐SEAL packing, refer to the retrofit kits listed in the Parts Kits section. 
Maintenance 
Valve parts are subject to normal wear and must be inspected and replaced as necessary. Inspection and maintenance frequency depends on the severity of service conditions. This section includes instructions for packing lubrication, packing maintenance, trim maintenance, and ENVIRO‐SEAL bellows seal bonnet replacement. All maintenance operations may be performed with the valve in the line. 
Avoid personal injury or property damage from sudden release of process pressure or bursting of parts. Before performing any maintenance operations: Instruction Manual D100398X012 ET Valve August 2021
� Do not remove the actuator from the valve while the valve is still pressurized. 
� Always wear protective gloves, clothing, and eyewear when performing any maintenance operations to avoid personal injury. 
� Disconnect any operating lines providing air pressure, electric power, or a control signal to the actuator. Be sure the actuator cannot suddenly open or close the valve. 
� Use bypass valves or completely shut off the process to isolate the valve from process pressure. Relieve process pressure from both sides of the valve. Drain the process media from both sides of the valve. 
� Vent the pneumatic actuator loading pressure and relieve any actuator spring precompression. 
� Use lock‐out procedures to be sure that the above measures stay in effect while you work on the equipment. 
� The valve packing box may contain process fluids that are pressurized, even when the valve has been removed from the pipeline. Process fluids may spray out under pressure when removing the packing hardware or packing rings, or when loosening the packing box pipe plug. 
� Check with your process or safety engineer for any additional measures that must be taken to protect against process media. 
CAUTION Follow instructions carefully to avoid damaging the product surfaces, which could result in damage to the product. Trim Cartridge is a single use repair solution. It is not recommended to remove and reinstall Trim Cartridge after initial installation so valve assemblies with Trim Cartridge will not support an open and inspect maintenance strategy. If the valve contains Trim Cartridge (Trim Cartridges can be identified by a name plate on the bonnet flange, the use of a packing nut, and “Fisher” embossed below the yoke mounting), please refer to Fisher ET and EZ easy-e Valves with Trim Cartridge Instruction Manual [(D104358X012)](https://www.emerson.com/documents/automation/instruction-manual-fisher-et-ez-easy-e-control-valves-trim-cartridge-en-7589820.pdf) for appropriate maintenance procedures.
  WARNING

Packing Lubrication To avoid personal injury or property damage resulting from fire or explosion, do not lubricate packing used in oxygen service or in processes with temperatures over 260�C (500�F).
If a lubricator or lubricator/isolating valve (figure 2) is provided for PTFE/composition or other packings that require lubrication, it will be installed in place of the pipe plug (key 14, figure 14). Use a good quality silicon‐base lubricant. Do not lubricate packing used in oxygen service or in processes with temperatures over 260�C (500�F). To operate the lubricator, simply turn the cap screw clockwise to force the lubricant into the packing box. The lubricator/isolating valve operates the same way except open the isolating valve before turning the cap screw and then close the isolating valve after lubrication is completed. 
Packing Maintenance 
Key numbers refer to figure 3 for PTFE V‐ring packing and to figure 4 for PTFE/composition packing, unless otherwise indicated. For spring‐loaded single PTFE V‐ring packing, the spring (key 8) maintains a sealing force on the packing. If leakage is noted around the packing follower (key 13), check to be sure the shoulder on the packing follower is touching the bonnet. If the shoulder is not touching the bonnet, tighten the packing flange nuts (key 5, figure 14) until the shoulder is against the bonnet. If leakage cannot be stopped in this manner, proceed to the Replacing Packing procedure.
Instruction Manual D100398X012 ET Valve August 2021 
Note Whenever a gasket seal is disturbed by removing or shifting gasketed parts, install a new gasket during reassembly. This ensures a good gasket seal because the used gasket may not seal properly.
Note 
ENVIRO‐SEAL and HIGH‐SEAL packing do not require lubrication. 
Note For valves with ENVIRO‐SEAL packing, see the Fisher instruction manual, ENVIRO‐SEAL Packing System for Sliding‐Stem Valves, [D101642X012,](http://www.emerson.com/documents/automation/127174.pdf) for packing instructions. For valves with HIGH‐SEAL packing, see the Fisher instruction manual, HIGH‐SEAL Live‐Loaded Packing System, [D101453X012](http://www.emerson.com/documents/automation/127164.pdf), for packing instructions.
Valve assemblies with Trim Cartridge utilize a packing nut design and are only available with ENVIRO-SEAL packing. If the valve contains Trim Cartridge (Trim Cartridges can be identified by a name plate on  the bonnet flange, the use of a packing nut, and “Fisher” embossed below the yoke mounting), please refer to Fisher ET and EZ easy-e Valves with Trim Cartridge Instruction Manual ([D104358X012](https://www.emerson.com/documents/automation/instruction-manual-fisher-et-ez-easy-e-control-valves-trim-cartridge-en-7589820.pdf)) for appropriate packing maintenance instructions.

  WARNING 
If there is undesirable packing leakage with other than spring‐loaded packing, first try to limit the leakage and establish a stem seal by tightening the packing flange nuts. 
If the packing is relatively new and tight on the stem, and if tightening the packing flange nuts does not stop the leakage, the valve stem may be worn or nicked so that a seal cannot be made. The surface finish of a new valve stem is critical for making a good packing seal. If the leakage comes from the outside diameter of the packing, the leakage may be caused by nicks or scratches around the packing box wall. If performing any of the following procedures, inspect the valve stem and packing box wall for nicks and scratches. 
Replacing Packing 
Refer to the WARNING at the beginning of the Maintenance section in this instruction manual. 
1.  Isolate the control valve from the line pressure, release pressure from both sides of the valve, and drain the process media from both sides of the valve. If using a power actuator, also shut off all pressure lines to the power actuator, and release all pressure from the actuator. Use lock‐out procedures to be sure that the above measures stay in effect while you work on the equipment. 
2.  Disconnect the operating lines from the actuator and any leak‐off piping from the bonnet. Disconnect the stem connector, then remove the actuator from the valve by unscrewing the yoke locknut (key 15, figure 14) or the hex nuts (key 26, figure 14). 
3.  Loosen the packing flange nuts (key 5, figure 14) so that the packing is not tight on the valve stem. Remove any travel indicator parts and stem locknuts from the valve stem threads. 
To avoid personal injury or property damage caused by uncontrolled movement of the bonnet, loosen the bonnet by following the instructions in the next step. Do not remove a stuck bonnet by pulling on it with equipment that can stretch or store energy in any other manner. The sudden release of stored energy can cause uncontrolled movement of the bonnet.

Note 
The following step also helps to provide additional assurance that the valve body fluid pressure has been relieved. 
CAUTION Avoid damaging the seating surface caused by the valve plug and stem assembly dropping from the bonnet (key 1, figure 14) after being lifted part way out. When lifting the bonnet, temporarily install a valve stem locknut on the valve stem. The locknut will prevent the valve plug and stem assembly from dropping out of the bonnet.

5.  Remove the locknut and separate the valve plug and stem from the bonnet. Set the parts on a protective surface to prevent damage to gasket or seating surfaces. 
6.  Remove the bonnet gasket (key 10, figure 16, 17, or 20) and cover the opening in the valve to protect the gasket surface and prevent foreign material from getting into the valve body cavity. 
7.  Remove the packing flange nuts, packing flange, upper wiper, and packing follower (keys 5, 3, 12, and 13, figure 14). Carefully push out all the remaining packing parts from the valve side of the bonnet using a rounded rod or other tool that will not scratch the packing box wall. Clean the packing box and the metal packing parts. 
8.  Inspect the valve stem threads and packing box surfaces for any sharp edges which might cut the packing. Scratches or burrs could cause packing box leakage or damage to the new packing. If the surface condition cannot be improved by light sanding, replace the damaged parts by following the appropriate steps in the Trim Maintenance procedure. 
9.  Remove the covering protecting the valve body cavity and install a new bonnet gasket (key 10, figure 16, 17, or 20), making sure the gasket seating surfaces are clean and smooth. Then slide the bonnet over the stem and onto the stud bolts (key 15, figure 16, 17, or 20) or onto the valve body cavity if cap screws (not shown) will be used instead.

Instruction Manual D100398X012 ET Valve August 2021 
Note 
Proper performance of the bolting procedures in step 10 compresses the spiral wound gasket (key 12, figure 16 or 17) or load ring (key 26, figure 20) enough to both load and seal the seat ring gasket (key 13, figure 16, 17 or 20). It also compresses the outer edge of the bonnet gasket (key 10, figure 16 through 20) enough to seal the body‐to‐bonnet joint. 
The proper bolting procedures in step 10 include‐‐but are not limited to‐‐ensuring that bolting threads are clean, and evenly tightening the cap screws, or the nuts onto the studs, in a crisscross pattern. Tightening one cap screw or nut may loosen an adjacent cap screw or nut. Repeat the crisscross tightening pattern several times until each cap screw or nut is tight and the body‐to‐bonnet seal is made.

10.  Lubricate the bolting (not necessary if factory pre‐lubricated stud bolt nuts are used) and install it, using accepted bolting procedures during tightening, so that the body‐to‐bonnet joint will withstand test pressures and application service conditions. Use the bolt torques in table 3 as guidelines. 
11.  Install new packing and the metal packing box parts according to the appropriate arrangement in figure 3, 4, or 5. Place a smooth‐edged pipe over the valve stem and gently tap each soft packing part into the packing box. 
12.  Slide the packing follower, upper wiper, and packing flange (keys 13, 12, and 3, figure 14) into position. Lubricate the packing flange studs (key 4, figure 14) and the faces of the packing flange nuts (key 5, figure 14). Install the packing flange nuts. 
13.  For spring‐loaded PTFE V‐ring packing, tighten the packing flange nuts until the shoulder on the packing follower (key 13, figure 14) contacts the bonnet. 
14.  Mount the actuator on the valve assembly and reconnect the actuator and valve stem according to the procedure in the appropriate actuator instruction manual.

Trim Maintenance 
Refer to the WARNING at the beginning of the Maintenance section in this instruction manual. 
Except where indicated, key numbers in this section are referenced in figure 16 for standard NPS 1 through 6 constructions, figure 17 for Whisper Trim III detail, figures 18 and 19 for WhisperFlo trim, figure 20 for Cavitrol III detail and the NPS 8 ET valve, and figures 22 through 25 for R31233 DST. 
Disassembly 1.  Remove the actuator and the bonnet according to steps 1 through 6 of the Replacing Packing procedure in the Maintenance section. 
To avoid personal injury due to leaking fluid, avoid damaging gasket sealing surfaces. The surface finish of the valve stem (key 7) is critical for making a good packing seal. The inside surface of the cage or cage/baffle assembly (key 3), or cage retainer (key 31), is critical for smooth operation of the valve plug. The seating surfaces of the valve plug (key 2) and seat ring (key 9) are critical for proper shutoff. Unless inspection reveals otherwise, assume all these parts are in good condition and protect them accordingly. 
2.  Remove the packing flange nuts, packing flange, upper wiper, and packing follower (keys 5, 3, 12, and 13 in figure 14). Carefully push out all the remaining packing parts from the valve side of the bonnet using a rounded rod or other tool that will not scratch the packing box wall. Clean the packing box and the metal packing parts. 
3.  Inspect the valve stem threads and packing box surfaces for any sharp edges which might cut the packing. Scratches or burrs could cause packing box leakage or damage to the new packing. If the surface condition cannot be improved by light sanding, replace the damaged parts. 
4.  Remove the load ring (key 26) from an NPS 8 ET valve, or the cage adaptor (key 4) from any restricted‐trim valve through NPS 4, and wrap it for protection. 
5.  On an NPS 6 ET valve with Whisper Trim III or WhisperFlo cage, also remove the bonnet spacer (key 32) and bonnet gasket (key 10) on top of the spacer. Then on any construction with a cage retainer (key 31), remove the cage retainer and its associated gaskets. A Whisper Trim III and WhisperFlo cage retainer has two 3/8‐inch‐16 UNC tappings in which screws or bolts can be installed for lifting.

If the valve contains Trim Cartridge (check if a Trim Cartridge name plate is present on the bonnet) please refer to Fisher ET and EZ easy-e Valves with Trim Cartridge Instruction Manual [(D104358X012](https://www.emerson.com/documents/automation/instruction-manual-fisher-et-ez-easy-e-control-valves-trim-cartridge-en-7589820.pdf)). 
CAUTION Trim Cartridge is a single use repair solution. It is not recommended to remove and reinstall Trim Cartridge after initial installation so valve assemblies with Trim Cartridge will not support an open and inspect maintenance strategy. If the valve contains Trim Cartridge (Trim Cartridges can be identified by a name plate on the bonnet flange, the use of a packing nut, and “Fisher” embossed below the yoke mounting), please refer to Fisher ET and EZ easy-e Valves with Trim Cartridge Instruction Manual [(D104358X012)](https://www.emerson.com/documents/automation/instruction-manual-fisher-et-ez-easy-e-control-valves-trim-cartridge-en-7589820.pdf) for appropriate maintenance procedures.

6.  Remove the cage or cage/baffle assembly (key 3), the associated gaskets (keys 10, 11, and 12), and shim (key 51). If the cage is stuck in the valve, use a rubber mallet to strike the exposed portion of the cage at several points around its circumference. 
7.  For constructions other than TSO (tight shutoff) trim, remove the seat ring or liner (key 9) or disk seat (key 22), seat ring gasket (key 13), and the seat ring adaptor (key 5) and adaptor gasket (key 14) where used in a restricted‐trim seat ring construction. PTFE‐seat constructions use a disk (key 23) sandwiched between the disk seat and disk retainer (key 21). 
8.  For TSO (tight shutoff) trim constructions, perform the following steps (refer to figures 6 and 7): 9.  For all constructions, inspect parts for wear or damage which would prevent proper operation of the valve. Replace or repair trim parts according to the following procedure for Lapping Metal Seats or other valve plug maintenance procedures as appropriate.
Disassembly for R31233 DST Constructions 
1.  Remove the actuator and the bonnet according to steps 1 through 6 of the Replacing Packing procedure in the Maintenance section. 
2.  Remove the packing flange nuts, packing flange, upper wiper, and packing follower (keys 5, 3, 12 and 13 in figure 14). Carefully push out all the remaining packing parts from the valve side of the bonnet using a rounded rod or other tool that will not scratch the packing box wall. Clean the packing box and the metal packing parts. 
3.  Inspect the valve stem threads and packing box surfaces for any sharp edges which might cut the packing. Scratches or burrs could cause packing box leakage or damage to the new packing. If the surface condition cannot be improved by light sanding, replace the damaged parts. 
4.  Carefully lift the valve plug/stem assembly (key 5) out of the valve and protect the stem and plug seating surfaces. 
The surface finish of the valve stem is critical for making a good packing seal. The inside surface of the cage is critical for smooth operation of the valve plug and for making a seal with the seal ring (key 8). The seating surfaces of the valve plug and the seat ring (if applicable, some designs may integrate the seat ring with the cage as a single element) on a metal-seat construction are critical for tight shutoff. Assume all these parts are in good condition and protect them accordingly, unless inspection reveals otherwise. 
5.  Remove the spiral wound gaskets (load ring used in the NPS 8 design as shown in figure 25) from the top of the cage (key 2) (some designs may refer to the cage as the upper cage, key 2A). 
6.  Remove the cage (key 2) or upper cage (key 2A), bonnet spacer (key 3 if applicable), seat ring (key 4 if applicable, some designs may integrate the seat ring with the cage as a single element), and remaining cage elements (key 2A 
Instruction Manual D100398X012 ET Valve August 2021 
CAUTION When lifting the valve plug/stem assembly out of the valve (key 5), be certain that the cage elements (key 2 or key 2A and 2B, and key 4) remain in the valve. This will prevent cage damage that might be caused by the cages dropping back into the valve after being lifted part way out. Use care to avoid damaging gasket sealing surfaces.
14 
a.  Remove the retainer, backup ring, anti‐extrusion rings, and piston ring. 
b.  Remove the set screws that lock the outer plug to the inner plug. 
c.  Using a strap wrench or similar tool, unscrew the outer plug from the inner plug. Do not damage the outer plug guide surfaces. 
d.  Remove the protected soft seat seal. 
e.  Inspect the parts for damage and replace if needed. 
7.  Inspect parts for wear or damage that would prevent proper operation of the valve. All gasket surfaces on the trim parts and in the body must be cleaned of any graphite residue and must be free from nicks and scratches. The seating surfaces of the valve plug and seat ring need to be free from nicks, scratches or any other damage for proper shut off. Replace or repair trim parts as needed. 
Lapping Metal Seats 
Except with respect to the ENVIRO‐SEAL Bellows Seal Bonnet assembly, with metal‐seat constructions, lapping seating surfaces of the valve plug and seat ring or liner (keys 2 and 9, figure 16, 17, or 20) can improve shutoff. (Deep nicks should be machined out rather than ground out.) Use a good quality lapping compound of a mixture of 280 to 600‐grit. Apply the compound to the bottom of the valve plug. 
Assemble the valve to the extent that the cage and the cage retainer and bonnet spacer (if used) are in place and the bonnet is bolted to the valve body. A simple handle can be made from a piece of strap iron locked to the valve plug stem with nuts. Rotate the handle alternately in each direction to lap the seats. After lapping, remove the bonnet and clean the seat surfaces. Completely assemble as described in the Assembly portion of the Trim Maintenance procedure and test the valve for shutoff. Repeat the lapping procedure if leakage is still excessive. 
Instruction Manual D100398X012 ET Valve August 2021 
Note 
The NPS 6 design (see figure 24) uses unique trim packaging method, so its bonnet spacer (key 3) should be removed first, followed by the spiral wound gaskets (key 65), and upper/lower cage parts (key 2A and 2B). The bonnet spacer has two 1/4-20 tapping holes into which bolts or screws can be installed for lifting. 
CAUTION To avoid damaging the ENVIRO‐SEAL Bellows Seal Bonnet assembly, do not attempt to lap the metal seating surfaces. The design of the assembly prevents rotation of the stem and any forced lapping rotation will damage internal components of the ENVIRO‐SEAL Bellows Seal bonnet. and 2B if applicable) from the valve body. A gasket is used between the cage and body. Where applicable, gaskets are also used between the cages or between cage and seat ring. Remove and discard these gaskets. The gaskets should not be reused.

VALVE PLUG SEAL 
2.  To replace the valve stem (key 7), drive out the pin (key 8). Unscrew the valve plug from the stem or adaptor. 
3.  To replace the adaptor (key 24, figure 14) on ENVIRO‐SEAL bellows seal bonnets, place the plug stem assembly and valve plug in a soft‐jaw chuck or other type of vise so that the jaws grip a portion of the valve plug that is not a seating surface. Drive out the pin (key 36, figure 14). Reverse the plug stem assembly in the soft‐jaw chuck or vise. 
Instruction Manual D100398X012 ET Valve August 2021 
CAUTION To avoid damaging the seal ring, slowly and gently stretch it for the following procedure. Avoid jerking sharply on the ring.
CAUTION Never reuse an old stem or adaptor with a new valve plug. Using an old stem or adaptor with a new plug requires drilling a new pin hole in the stem (or adaptor, in case an ENVIRO‐SEAL bellows seal bonnet is being used). This drilling weakens the stem or adaptor and may cause failure in service. However, a used valve plug may be reused with a new stem or adaptor, except with Cavitrol III trim.
Note 
The valve plug and valve plug stem for 2‐stage Cavitrol III trim are a matched set and must be ordered together. If the 2‐stage Cavitrol III valve plug or valve plug stem is damaged, replace the entire assembly (key 2, figure 20). For plain bonnets and style 1 extension bonnets, the valve plug (key 2), valve stem (key 7), and pin (key 8) are available completely assembled. Refer to the key 2, 7, and 8 Valve Plug and Stem Assembly tables in the Parts List.
To install a new two‐piece seal ring, apply a general purpose silicone‐base lubricant to both the backup ring and seal ring (keys 29 and 28). Place the backup ring over the stem (key 7) and into the groove. Place the seal ring over the top edge of the valve plug (key 2) so that it enters the groove on one side of the valve plug. Slowly and gently stretch the seal ring and work it over the top edge of the valve plug. The PTFE material in the seal ring must be permitted time to cold‐flow during the stretching procedure, so avoid jerking sharply on this ring. Stretching the seal ring over the valve plug may make it seem unduly loose when in the groove, but it will contract to its original size after insertion into the cage. For the spring‐loaded seal ring, the ring used on a valve plug having a 136.5 mm (5.375 inch) or less port diameter may be removed undamaged by first working the retaining ring (key 27) off with a screwdriver. Then carefully slide the metal backup ring (key 29) and seal ring (key 28) off the valve plug (key 2). The spring‐loaded seal ring used on a valve plug having a 178 mm (7‐inch) or greater port diameter must be carefully pried and/or cut from its groove. Therefore, it cannot be reused.
A spring‐loaded seal ring must be installed so that its open side faces toward the valve stem, or toward the seat of the plug depending on flow direction, as shown in view A of figure 16 or 20. To install a spring‐loaded seal ring on a valve plug with a 136.5 mm (5.375 inch) or less port diameter, slide the seal ring (key 28) onto the valve plug followed by the metal backup ring (key 29). Then install the retaining ring (key 27) by inserting one end in the groove and, while turning the plug, press the ring into the groove. Again, be careful not to scratch any surfaces of the ring or plug. 
To install the seal ring on a valve plug with 178 mm (7‐inch) or greater port diameter, lubricate it with a general purpose silicone‐base lubricant. Then gently stretch the seal ring and work it over the top edge of the valve plug. The PTFE material in the seal ring must be permitted time to cold‐flow during the stretching procedure, so avoid jerking sharply on the ring. Stretching the seal ring over the valve plug may make it seem unduly loose when in the groove, but it will contract to its original size after insertion into the cage.

5.  For ENVIRO‐SEAL bellows seal bonnets, grip the flats of the stem extending out of the top of the bellows shroud with a soft‐jaw chuck or other type of vise. Screw the valve plug/adaptor assembly onto the valve stem. Tighten as necessary to align the pin hole in the stem with one of the holes in the adaptor. Secure the adaptor to the stem with a new pin. 
Valve Plug Maintenance for R31233 DST Constructions 
Except where indicated, key numbers in this section are referenced in figures 22 through 25 for NPS 3 through 8 valve constructions with R31233 DST. 
With the valve plug removed, according to the Trim Disassembly section of this manual, proceed as appropriate: 1.  Inspect the valve plug (key 5) and stem for nicks, scratches, or other damage that would prevent proper operation of the valve. If replacement of either is necessary, replace as a complete valve plug and stem assembly (key 5).
2.  All DST trims use the spring-loaded seal ring (key 8) as the sealing element between plug and cage (key 2 or 2A). The spring-loaded seal ring may be removed by first working the retaining ring (key 10) off with a screwdriver. Then, carefully slide the metal backup ring (key 9), anti-extrusion ring (key 63), and seal ring (key 8) off the valve plug. Inspect the retaining ring and backup ring for damage and replace as needed. Discard the old plug seal ring and anti-extrusion ring. 
3.  The spring-loaded seal ring (key 8) must be installed so that the open side faces toward the seat of the plug, as shown in figures 22 through 25. To install the spring-loaded seal ring on a valve plug, first lubricate it with a general purpose silicone-base lubricant, then gently slide the seal ring (key 8) and anti-extrusion ring (key 63) onto the valve plug followed by the metal backup ring (key 9). Then, install the retaining ring (key 10) by inserting one end in the groove end, while turning the plug, press the ring into the groove. Use caution not to scratch any surfaces of the ring or plug.

Grip the flat areas on the valve stem just below the threads for the actuator/stem connection. Unscrew the valve plug/adaptor assembly (key 24, figure 14) from the valve stem assembly (key 20, figure 14). 
3.  Install the cage or cage/baffle assembly (key 3). Any rotational orientation of the cage or assembly with respect to the valve body is acceptable. A Whisper Trim III cage designated by level A3, B3, or C3 may be installed with either end up. The level D3 cage/baffle assembly or Cavitrol III cage assembly, however, must be installed with the hole pattern end next to the seat ring. If a cage retainer (key 31) is to be used, place it on top of the cage. 
4.  For constructions other than TSO (tight shutoff) trim, slide the valve plug (key 2) and stem assembly, or valve plug and ENVIRO‐SEAL bellows seal assembly, into the cage. Make sure the seal ring (key 28) is evenly engaged in the entrance chamfer at the top of the cage (key 3) or cage retainer (key 31) to avoid damaging the ring. 
5.  For TSO (tight shutoff) trim constructions, perform the following steps (refer to figures 6 and 7). 
6.  For all constructions, place the gaskets (keys 12, 11 or 14 if used, and 10) and the shim (key 51) on top of the cage or cage retainer. If there is a cage adaptor (key 4) or a bonnet spacer (key 32), set it on the cage or cage retainer gaskets and place another flat sheet gasket (key 10) on top of the adaptor or spacer. If there is only a cage retainer, place another flat sheet gasket on the retainer. 
7.  With an NPS 8 ET valve, install the load ring (key 26). 
8.  Mount the bonnet on the valve body and complete assembly according to steps 10 through 14 of the Replacing Packing procedure. Be sure to observe the note prior to step 10. 
Assembly for R31233 DST Constructions After all trim maintenance has been completed, reassemble the valve by following the numbered steps below. Be certain that all gasket surfaces have been well cleaned.
Proceed as appropriate: For construction with a one-piece cage: 1.  Install the body-cage gasket (key 19) into the gasket surface in the bottom of the valve body (key 1). Install the cage (key 2) into the valve body, being careful that the gasket remains in proper alignment.
2.  If a bonnet spacer (key 3) is used in the assembly, install a new body-to-bonnet spacer gasket (key 68) into the groove on top of the valve. Lower the bonnet spacer onto the valve body. 
Instruction Manual D100398X012 ET Valve August 2021 
CAUTION Inspect the gasket surfaces of all parts. These surfaces must be in good condition, with all foreign material removed. Small burrs less than approximately 0.076 mm (0.003 inches) in height can be ignored. Scratches or burrs that run across the serrations are not permitted under any conditions, because they will prevent the gaskets from sealing properly.
a.  Thread the outer plug onto the inner plug until the parts seat metal to metal, using a strap wrench or similar tool that will not damage the outer plug guide surfaces. 
b.  Mark the top of the inner plug and outer plug with alignment marks in the assembled position. 
c.  Disassemble the outer plug from the inner plug and install the seal over the inner plug, so that the seal rests below the threaded area. 
d.  Thread the outer plug onto the inner plug and tighten with a strap wrench or similar tool until the alignment marks line up. This will ensure that the plug parts are metal to metal and the seal is compressed properly. Do not damage the outer plug guide surfaces. 
e.  Install set screws centering the inner plug in the outer plug and torque to 11 N�m (8 lbf�ft). 
f.  Assemble the piston ring, anti‐extrusion rings, backup ring, and retainer.

3.  Install the spiral wound gaskets (key 65) on top of the cage (key 2). 
4.  Install new seal ring (key 8) on the valve plug (see the Valve Plug Maintenance section). Inspect and replace as necessary. Install the valve plug/stem assembly (key 5) into the cage (key 2), being careful not to damage the rings, make sure the plug/stem assembly is properly centered on the seating position. Also, make sure the valve plug sealing parts are evenly engaged by the chamfer in the top inside diameter of the cage (key 2). 
5.  Install a new bonnet gasket (key 11) into the gasket groove of the bonnet spacer (key 3, if equipped). Slide the bonnet (key 18) over the valve stem and complete the assembly according to steps 11 through 15 of the Replacing Packing section. Be sure to observe the note and caution prior to step 11. For construction with multi-cage elements: 1.  Install the body-cage gasket (key 19) into the gasket surface in the bottom of the valve body (key 1). Install the lower cage (key 2B) into the valve body, being careful the gasket remains in proper alignment.
2.  If a separated seat ring part (key 4) is used in the assembly (see figure 25), install the gasket (key 12) into the gasket seating surface on the top of the lower cage (key 2B). Install the seat ring (key 4) into the valve body, being careful that the gasket remains in proper alignment. The seat ring must fit over the guide boss on the lower cage. 
3.  If a bonnet spacer (key 3) is used in the assembly, install a new body-to-bonnet spacer gasket (key 68) into the groove on top of the valve body (key 1). Lower the bonnet spacer onto the valve body. For NPS 6 design, the upper cage (key 2A) should be installed first, then the bonnet spacer (key 3). 
4.  Install the upper cage (key 2A) on top of the seat ring (key 4) or lower cage (key 2B) depending on different constructions. Attention should be paid to make sure appropriate guiding and fit. Install the spiral wound gasket (key 65) or load ring (key 69 in figure 25) on top of the upper cage (key 2A). 
5.  Install new seal on the valve plug (see the Valve Plug Maintenance section). Inspect and replace as necessary. Install the valve plug/stem assembly (key 5) into the cage(s), being careful not to damage the rings, make sure the plug/stem assembly is properly centered on the seating position. Also, make sure the valve plug sealing parts are evenly engaged by the chamfer in the top inside diameter of the cage. 
6.  Install a new bonnet gasket (key 11) into the gasket groove of the bonnet spacer (key 3, if equipped). Slide the bonnet (key 18) over the valve stem and complete the assembly according to steps 11 through 15 of the Replacing Packing section. Be sure to observe the note and caution prior to step 11.

CAUTION To prevent possible product damage, cover the opening in the valve in the following procedure to protect the sealing surfaces and to prevent foreign material from getting into the valve body cavity.
20 For NPS 6, 3-stage (see figure 24), a gasket (key 12) is used between upper cage (key 2A) and lower cage (key 2B). Install the gasket into the gasket seating surface on the top of the lower cage (key 2B). Install the upper cage (key 2A) into the valve body, being careful that the gasket remains in proper alignment. The upper cage (key 2A) must fit over the guide boss on the lower cage (key 2B). Install the spiral wound gaskets (key 65) next and then the bonnet spacer (key 3).
3.  Remove and discard the existing bonnet gasket. Cover the valve body opening to protect sealing surfaces and to prevent foreign material from entering the valve body cavity. 
4.  Inspect the existing valve plug. If the plug is in good condition, it can be reused with the new ENVIRO‐SEAL stem/bellows assembly. To remove the existing valve plug from the stem, first, place the existing plug stem assembly and valve plug in a soft‐jaw chuck or other type of vise so that the jaws grip a portion of the valve plug that is not a seating surface. Drive out or drill out the pin (key 8).

12.  Properly lubricate the bonnet stud bolts. Install and tighten the bonnet hex nuts to the proper torque. 13.  Install new packing and the metal packing box parts according to the appropriate arrangement in figure 8 or 9. 14.  Install the packing flange. Properly lubricate the packing flange stud bolts and the faces of the packing flange nuts. 
15.  Install travel indicator parts and stem locknuts; mount the actuator on the valve body according to the procedure in the appropriate actuator instruction manual. 
Replacement of an Installed ENVIRO‐SEAL Bellows Seal Bonnet (Stem/Bellows Assembly) 1.  Remove the actuator and bonnet according to steps 1 through 5 of the Replacing Packing procedure in the Maintenance section. 
2.  Carefully remove the ENVIRO‐SEAL stem/bellows assembly. If necessary, also lift out the cage. Remove and discard the existing bonnet gasket and bellows gasket. Cover the valve body opening to protect sealing surfaces and to prevent foreign material from entering the valve body cavity. 
3.  Inspect the existing valve plug and adaptor. If they are in good condition, they can be reused with the new stem/bellows assembly and they do not need to be separated. 
Instruction Manual D100398X012 ET Valve August 2021 
Personal injury or damage to equipment could occur if improper stud and nut materials or parts are used. Do not operate or assemble this product with stud(s) and nut(s) that are not approved by Emerson/Fisher engineering and/or listed on the serial card provided with this product. Use of unapproved materials and parts could lead to stresses exceeding the design or code limits intended for this particular service. Install studs with the material grade and manufacturer's identification mark visible. Contact your Emerson representative immediately if a discrepancy between actual parts and approved parts is suspected. 
CAUTION To prevent possible product damage, cover the opening in the valve in the following procedure to protect the sealing surfaces and to prevent foreign material from getting into the valve body cavity.
CAUTION The ENVIRO‐SEAL stem/bellows assembly for easy-e valves is available only with a threaded and drilled plug/adaptor/stem connection. The existing valve plug can be reused with the new stem/bellows assembly or a new plug can be installed. If the existing valve plug is reused, and the adaptor is in good condition, it may be also reused. However, never reuse an old adaptor with a new valve plug. Using an old adaptor with a new valve plug requires drilling a new pin hole in the adaptor. This drilling weakens the adaptor and may cause failure in service. However, a used valve plug may be reused with a new adaptor, except with Cavitrol III trim.
CAUTION When removing/installing a valve plug on the ENVIRO‐SEAL stem/bellows assembly, the valve stem must not be rotated. Damage to the bellows may result.
WARNING For graphite packing, tighten the packing flange nuts to the maximum recommended torque shown in table 6. Then, loosen the packing flange nuts, and retighten them to the recommended minimum torque shown in table 6. For other packing types, tighten the packing flange nuts alternately in small equal increments until one of the nuts reaches the minimum recommended torque shown in table 6. Then, tighten the remaining flange nut until the packing flange is level and at a 90‐degree angle to the valve stem.

4.  If the valve plug and adaptor are not in good condition and must be replaced, first remove the valve plug/adaptor assembly from the stem/bellows assembly; then remove the valve plug from the adaptor. First, place the stem/bellows assembly and valve plug in a soft‐jaw chuck or other type of vise so that the jaws grip a portion of the valve plug that is not a seating surface. Drive out or drill out the pin (key 8, figure 16, 17, or 20). Drive out the pin (key 36, figure 14). 
5.  Reverse the stem/bellows and plug/adaptor assembly in the soft‐jaw chuck or vise. Grip the flat areas on the valve stem just below the threads for the actuator/stem connection. Unscrew the plug/adaptor assembly from the stem/bellows assembly. Unscrew the valve plug from the adaptor. 
6.  To attach either the existing valve plug or a new one to the stem of the new ENVIRO‐SEAL stem/bellows assembly, first attach the plug to the adaptor (if the valve plug was removed from the adaptor) as follows: 7.  Complete the installation by following steps 7 through 9 and steps 12 through 15 of the ENVIRO‐SEAL Bellows Seal Bonnet installation instructions found on pages 14 and 15.
Instruction Manual D100398X012 ET Valve August 2021 
To avoid product damage, do not grip the bellows shroud or other parts of the stem/bellows assembly. Grip only the flat areas on the stem where it extends out of the top of the bellows shroud. 
Note 
The ENVIRO‐SEAL stem/bellows assembly has a one‐piece stem. 
CAUTION To avoid damaging parts, do not grip the valve plug on any seating surface in the following procedure.

a.  Locate the adaptor. Notice that a hole has not been drilled in the threads where the plug screws onto the adaptor. 
b.  Secure the valve plug in a soft‐jaw chuck or other type of vise. Do not grip the plug on any seating surface. Position the plug in the chuck or vise for easy threading of the adaptor. 
c.  Thread the adaptor into the valve plug and tighten to the appropriate torque value.
