# Installation

![WARNING](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anvlasov/pdfParser/main/pics/Icon1.png)
**WARNING**  
Always wear protective gloves, clothing, and eyewear when performing any installation operations to avoid personal injury.  
Personal injury or equipment damage caused by sudden release of pressure may result if the valve assembly is installed where service conditions could exceed the limits given in table 1 or on the appropriate nameplates. To avoid such injury or damage, provide a relief valve for over‐pressure protection as required by government or accepted industry codes and good engineering practices.  
Check with your process or safety engineer for any additional measures that must be taken to protect against process media.  
If installing into an existing application, also refer to the WARNING at the beginning of the Maintenance section in this instruction manual.  
***

**CAUTION**  
When ordered, the valve configuration and construction materials were selected to meet particular pressure, temperature, pressure drop, and controlled fluid conditions. Responsibility for the safety of process media and compatibility of valve materials with process media rests solely with the purchaser and end‐user. Since some valve body/trim material combinations are limited in their pressure drop and temperature ranges, do not apply any other conditions to the valve without first contacting your [Emerson sales office](https://www.emerson.com/en-us/automation/fisher).  
Before installing the valve, inspect the valve and pipelines for any damage and any foreign material which may cause product damage.  
***

1. Before installing the valve, inspect the valve and associated equipment for any damage and any foreign material.  
2. Make certain the valve body interior is clean, that pipelines are free of foreign material, and that the valve is oriented so that pipeline flow is in the same direction as the arrow on the side of the valve.  
3. The control valve assembly may be installed in any orientation unless limited by seismic criteria. However, the normal method is with the actuator vertical above the valve. Other positions may result in uneven valve plug and cage wear, and improper operation. With some valves, the actuator may also need to be supported when it is not vertical. For more information, consult your [Emerson sales office](https://www.emerson.com/en-us/automation/fisher).  
4. Use accepted piping and welding practices when installing the valve in the line. For flanged valves, use a suitable gasket between the valve and pipeline flanges.  

**CAUTION**  
Depending on valve body materials used, post weld heat treating may be required. If so, damage to internal elastomeric and plastic parts, as well as internal metal parts is possible. Shrink‐fit pieces and threaded connections may also loosen. In general, if post weld heat treating is to be performed, all trim parts should be removed. Contact your Emerson sales office
for additional information.  
***

5. With a leak‐off bonnet construction, remove the pipe plugs (keys 14 and 16, figure 14) to hook up the leak‐off piping. If continuous operation is required during inspection or maintenance, install a three‐valve bypass around the control valve assembly.
6. If the actuator and valve are shipped separately, refer to the actuator mounting procedure in the appropriate actuator instruction manual.

![WARNING](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anvlasov/pdfParser/main/pics/Icon1.png)
**WARNING**  
Personal injury could result from packing leakage. Valve packing was tightened prior to shipment; however, the packing might require some readjustment to meet specific service conditions. Check with your process or safety engineer for any additional measures that must be taken to protect against process media.
***

Valves with ENVIRO‐SEAL live‐loaded packing or HIGH‐SEAL live‐loaded packing will not require this initial readjustment. See the Fisher instruction manuals, ENVIRO‐SEAL Packing System for Sliding‐Stem Valves or HIGH‐SEAL Live‐Loaded Packing System (as appropriate), for packing instructions. If you wish to convert your present packing arrangement to ENVIRO‐SEAL packing, refer to the retrofit kits listed in the Parts Kits section.

# Maintenance

Valve parts are subject to normal wear and must be inspected and replaced as necessary. Inspection and maintenance frequency depends on the severity of service conditions. This section includes instructions for packing lubrication, packing maintenance, trim maintenance, and ENVIRO‐SEAL bellows seal bonnet replacement. All maintenance operations may be performed with the valve in the line.

![WARNING](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anvlasov/pdfParser/main/pics/Icon1.png)
**WARNING**  
**Avoid personal injury or property damage from sudden release of process pressure or bursting of parts. Before performing any maintenance operations:**
- **Do not remove the actuator from the valve while the valve is still pressurized.**
- **Always wear protective gloves, clothing, and eyewear when performing any maintenance operations to avoid personal injury.**
- **Disconnect any operating lines providing air pressure, electric power, or a control signal to the actuator. Be sure the actuator cannot suddenly open or close the valve.**
- **Use bypass valves or completely shut off the process to isolate the valve from process pressure. Relieve process pressure from both sides of the valve. Drain the process media from both sides of the valve.**
- **Vent the pneumatic actuator loading pressure and relieve any actuator spring precompression.**
- **Use lock‐out procedures to be sure that the above measures stay in effect while you work on the equipment.**
- **The valve packing box may contain process fluids that are pressurized, even when the valve has been removed from the pipeline. Process fluids may spray out under pressure when removing the packing hardware or packing rings, or when loosening the packing box pipe plug.**
- **Check with your process or safety engineer for any additional measures that must be taken to protect against process media.**
***

**CAUTION**  
Follow instructions carefully to avoid damaging the product surfaces, which could result in damage to the product.  
Trim Cartridge is a single use repair solution. It is not recommended to remove and reinstall Trim Cartridge after initial installation so valve assemblies with Trim Cartridge will not support an open and inspect maintenance strategy. If the valve contains Trim Cartridge (Trim Cartridges can be identified by a name plate on the bonnet flange, the use of a packing nut, and “Fisher” embossed below the yoke mounting), please refer to Fisher ET and EZ easy-e Valves with Trim Cartridge Instruction Manual ([D104358X012](https://www.emerson.com/documents/automation/instruction-manual-fisher-et-ez-easy-e-control-valves-trim-cartridge-en-7589820.pdf)) for appropriate maintenance procedures.

***

**Note**  
Whenever a gasket seal is disturbed by removing or shifting gasketed parts, install a new gasket during reassembly. This ensures a good gasket seal because the used gasket may not seal properly.  
***

## Packing Lubrication

***  
**Note**  
ENVIRO‐SEAL and HIGH‐SEAL packing do not require lubrication.  
***

![WARNING](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anvlasov/pdfParser/main/pics/Icon1.png)
**WARNING** 
**To avoid personal injury or property damage resulting from fire or explosion, do not lubricate packing used in oxygen service or in processes with temperatures over 260&deg;C (500&deg;F).**  
***

If a lubricator or lubricator/isolating valve (figure 2) is provided for PTFE/composition or other packings that require lubrication, it will be installed in place of the pipe plug (key 14, figure 14). Use a good quality silicon‐base lubricant. Do not lubricate packing used in oxygen service or in processes with temperatures over 260&deg;C (500&deg;F). To operate the lubricator, simply turn the cap screw clockwise to force the lubricant into the packing box. The lubricator/isolating valve operates the same way except open the isolating valve before turning the cap screw and then close the isolating valve after lubrication is completed.

## Packing Maintenance

***
**Note**  
For valves with ENVIRO‐SEAL packing, see the Fisher instruction manual, ENVIRO‐SEAL Packing System for Sliding‐Stem Valves, [D101642X012](https://www.emerson.com/documents/automation/127174.pdf), for packing instructions.  
For valves with HIGH‐SEAL packing, see the Fisher instruction manual, HIGH‐SEAL Live‐Loaded Packing System, [D101453X012](https://www.emerson.com/documents/automation/127164.pdf), for packing instructions.  
Valve assemblies with Trim Cartridge utilize a packing nut design and are only available with ENVIRO-SEAL packing. If the valve contains Trim Cartridge (Trim Cartridges can be identified by a name plate on the bonnet flange, the use of a packing nut, and “Fisher” embossed below the yoke mounting), please refer to Fisher ET and EZ easy-e Valves with Trim Cartridge Instruction Manual ([D104358X012](https://www.emerson.com/documents/automation/instruction-manual-fisher-et-ez-easy-e-control-valves-trim-cartridge-en-7589820.pdf)) for appropriate packing maintenance instructions.  
***

Key numbers refer to figure 3 for PTFE V‐ring packing and to figure 4 for PTFE/composition packing, unless otherwise indicated.

For spring‐loaded single PTFE V‐ring packing, the spring (key 8) maintains a sealing force on the packing. If leakage is noted around the packing follower (key 13), check to be sure the shoulder on the packing follower is touching the bonnet. If the shoulder is not touching the bonnet, tighten the packing flange nuts (key 5, figure 14) until the shoulder is against the bonnet. If leakage cannot be stopped in this manner, proceed to the Replacing Packing procedure.

***

If there is undesirable packing leakage with other than spring‐loaded packing, first try to limit the leakage and establish a stem seal by tightening the packing flange nuts.

If the packing is relatively new and tight on the stem, and if tightening the packing flange nuts does not stop the leakage, the valve stem may be worn or nicked so that a seal cannot be made. The surface finish of a new valve stem is critical for making a good packing seal. If the leakage comes from the outside diameter of the packing, the leakage may be caused by nicks or scratches around the packing box wall. If performing any of the following procedures, inspect the valve stem and packing box wall for nicks and scratches.

### Replacing Packing

![WARNING](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anvlasov/pdfParser/main/pics/Icon1.png)
**WARNING**  
**Refer to the WARNING at the beginning of the Maintenance section in this instruction manual.**  
***

1. Isolate the control valve from the line pressure, release pressure from both sides of the valve, and drain the process media from both sides of the valve. If using a power actuator, also shut off all pressure lines to the power actuator, and release all pressure from the actuator. Use lock‐out procedures to be sure that the above measures stay in effect while you work on the equipment.
2. Disconnect the operating lines from the actuator and any leak‐off piping from the bonnet. Disconnect the stem connector, then remove the actuator from the valve by unscrewing the yoke locknut (key 15, figure 14) or the hex nuts (key 26, figure 14).
3. Loosen the packing flange nuts (key 5, figure 14) so that the packing is not tight on the valve stem. Remove any travel indicator parts and stem locknuts from the valve stem threads.

![WARNING](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anvlasov/pdfParser/main/pics/Icon1.png)
**WARNING**  
**To avoid personal injury or property damage caused by uncontrolled movement of the bonnet, loosen the bonnet by following the instructions in the next step. Do not remove a stuck bonnet by pulling on it with equipment that can stretch or store energy in any other manner. The sudden release of stored energy can cause uncontrolled movement of the bonnet.**

**Note**  
The following step also helps to provide additional assurance that the valve body fluid pressure has been relieved.  
***

**CAUTION**  
**Avoid damaging the seating surface caused by the valve plug and stem assembly dropping from the bonnet (key 1, figure 14) after being lifted part way out. When lifting the bonnet, temporarily install a valve stem locknut on the valve stem. The locknut will prevent the valve plug and stem assembly from dropping out of the bonnet.**

4. Hex nuts (key 16, figure 16, 17, or 20) or cap screws (not shown) attach the bonnet (key 1, figure 14) to the valve body (key 1, figure 16, 17, or 20). Loosen these nuts or cap screws approximately 3 mm (1/8 inch). Then loosen the body‐to‐bonnet gasketed joint by either rocking the bonnet or prying between the bonnet and valve. Work the prying tool around the bonnet until the bonnet loosens. If no fluid leaks from the joint, remove the nuts or cap screws completely and carefully lift the bonnet off the valve.

5. Remove the locknut and separate the valve plug and stem from the bonnet. Set the parts on a protective surface to prevent damage to gasket or seating surfaces.

**CAUTION**  
**To prevent possible product damage, cover the opening in the valve in the following procedure to prevent foreign material from getting into the valve body cavity.**  
***

6. Remove the bonnet gasket (key 10, figure 16, 17, or 20) and cover the opening in the valve to protect the gasket surface and prevent foreign material from getting into the valve body cavity.
7. Remove the packing flange nuts, packing flange, upper wiper, and packing follower (keys 5, 3, 12, and 13, figure 14). Carefully push out all the remaining packing parts from the valve side of the bonnet using a rounded rod or other tool that will not scratch the packing box wall. Clean the packing box and the metal packing parts.
8. Inspect the valve stem threads and packing box surfaces for any sharp edges which might cut the packing. Scratches or burrs could cause packing box leakage or damage to the new packing. If the surface condition cannot be improved by light sanding, replace the damaged parts by following the appropriate steps in the Trim Maintenance procedure.
9. Remove the covering protecting the valve body cavity and install a new bonnet gasket (key 10, figure 16, 17, or 20), making sure the gasket seating surfaces are clean and smooth. Then slide the bonnet over the stem and onto the stud bolts (key 15, figure 16, 17, or 20) or onto the valve body cavity if cap screws (not shown) will be used instead.

**Note**  
Proper performance of the bolting procedures in step 10 compresses the spiral wound gasket (key 12, figure 16 or 17) or load ring (key 26, figure 20) enough to both load and seal the seat ring gasket (key 13, figure 16, 17 or 20). It also compresses the outer edge of the bonnet gasket (key 10, figure 16 through 20) enough to seal the body‐to‐bonnet joint.

The proper bolting procedures in step 10 include‐‐but are not limited to‐‐ensuring that bolting threads are clean, and evenly tightening the cap screws, or the nuts onto the studs, in a crisscross pattern. Tightening one cap screw or nut may loosen an adjacent cap screw or nut. Repeat the crisscross tightening pattern several times until each cap screw or nut is tight and the body‐to‐bonnet seal is made.

**WARNING**  
**Personal injury or damage to equipment could occur if improper stud and nut materials or parts are used. Do not operate or assemble this product with stud(s) and nut(s) that are not approved by Emerson/Fisher engineering and/or listed on the serial card provided with this product. Use of unapproved materials and parts could lead to stresses exceeding the design or code limits intended for this particular service. Install studs with the material grade and manufacturer's identification mark visible. Contact your Emerson representative immediately if a discrepancy between actual parts and approved parts is suspected.**  
***

10. Lubricate the bolting (not necessary if factory pre‐lubricated stud bolt nuts are used) and install it, using accepted bolting procedures during tightening, so that the body‐to‐bonnet joint will withstand test pressures and application service conditions. Use the bolt torques in table 3 as guidelines.
11. Install new packing and the metal packing box parts according to the appropriate arrangement in figure 3, 4, or 5. Place a smooth‐edged pipe over the valve stem and gently tap each soft packing part into the packing box.
12. Slide the packing follower, upper wiper, and packing flange (keys 13, 12, and 3, figure 14) into position. Lubricate the packing flange studs (key 4, figure 14) and the faces of the packing flange nuts (key 5, figure 14). Install the packing flange nuts.
13. **For spring‐loaded PTFE V‐ring packing,** tighten the packing flange nuts until the shoulder on the packing follower (key 13, figure 14) contacts the bonnet.

    **For graphite packing,** tighten the packing flange nuts to the maximum recommended torque shown in table 4. Then, loosen the packing flange nuts, and retighten them to the recommended minimum torque shown in table 4.
    
    **For other packing types,** tighten the packing flange nuts alternately in small equal increments until one of the nuts reaches the minimum recommended torque shown in table 4. Then, tighten the remaining flange nut until the packing flange is level and at a 90‐degree angle to the valve stem.
    
    **For ENVIRO‐SEAL or HIGH‐SEAL live‐loaded packing,** refer to the note at the beginning of Packing Maintenance.
    
14. Mount the actuator on the valve assembly and reconnect the actuator and valve stem according to the procedure in the appropriate actuator instruction manual.
